PCat-DNest Optimize Project
===========================

PCat-DNest is a probabilistic astronomy image cataloger (finds stars in
telescopy images). As an experiment, I optimized PCat to see how much 
performance was left on the table. A fair bit. I managed a 340% speedup!

Read about how I managed the 3.4x speed boost here: http://vt200.com/perf-tuning-pcat-dnest
